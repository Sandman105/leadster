When creating a new account,the user will have the option of choosing the account type, if the user is seeking available services, then the user will choose <b>Seeker</b> from the dropdown. If the user is a service provider, the user will choose <b>Service Provider</b> from the dropdown. Once the user information is completed and account type is chosen and submitted, the user will be routed to either <b>Community</b> page, which is for the <b>Seeker</b> account or the <b>Service Provider Detail</b> page, which is for the <b>Service Provider</b>. The <b>Community</b> page allows the <b>Seeker</b> to see a list of all the current available services that are posted by the <b>Service Provider</b>. The <b>Seeker</b> can review the services, click on a service and view the detail of that service. If the service is something the <b>Seeker</b> is interested in, then the <b>Seeker</b> can save the information to their profile. The <b>Seeker</b> can contact the <b>Service Provider</b> via email. On <b>Service Provider Detail</b> page the <b>Service Provider</b> can view their own posts and also create new posts for the <b>Seeker</b> to view and add. The <b>Service Provider</b> can also view all of the <b>Seeker</b> who have saved the listing to their profile.</p>
