# leadster

Leadster is a React-based application.

<br>
<p>Leadster is a full stack, React-based application which also uses Node, Express, Axios, and Mongoose to call the Google Book API to find your favorite book and save that book to the user book list in a Mongo database.</p>
<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To use the Leadster Search application, simply navigate to <a href="#" rel="nofollow">Google-Books-Search</a>, then go to the <b>Search For Book</b> search field and enter the title of a book to search. The search will return a matching title or titles. From there, the user will be provided a summary of the book and be able to <b>Save</b> the book to the book list by clicking on the <b>Save Book</b> button. Once the book is saved, the user can view the <i>saved books list</i> by navigating to the top of the page and clicking on <b>Saved</b>. The user will be redirected to the <i>saved books list</i> and can view all the saved books. The user can also remove a book from the user book list by clicking on <b>Remove Book</b> button. The user can navigate back to the top of the page and click on the <b>Search</b> button to return to the main page to perform additional searches.</p>
